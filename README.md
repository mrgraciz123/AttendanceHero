# Attendance Hero 🦸‍♂️📊

Attendance Hero is a client-side web application designed to help students personally track their course attendance. Users can add courses, log their attendance for specific dates and times (Present, Absent, Late, etc.), and view statistics to monitor if they are meeting their required attendance percentages (e.g., 75%).

All data is stored locally in the user's web browser using `localStorage`, meaning no backend server is required and the application can work offline after the initial load. The interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Key Features:
*   Add, edit, and delete courses.
*   Log attendance per class session (date and time specific).
*   View overall and per-course attendance statistics.
*   Calculate how many classes can be missed or need to be attended to meet targets.
*   Data persistence via browser's local storage.

## Technologies:
*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Vanilla JavaScript
